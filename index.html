    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>

    <p><b>Albert Einstein</b> was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, 
    one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. 
    His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, 
    where his father and uncle founded an electrical equipment manufacturing company.</p>

    <p>Albert showed an early interest in science and mathematics. He was known for his curiosity and independent thinking.
    At the age of 16, he renounced his German citizenship and later became a Swiss citizen. He studied at the Swiss Federal 
    Polytechnic in Zurich, graduating in 1900 with a diploma in teaching physics and mathematics.</p>

    <p>In 1905, often referred to as his "Annus Mirabilis" (Miracle Year), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.
    These included the theory of special relativity and the famous equation E=mc², which expresses the relationship 
    between mass and energy.</p>

    <p>He worked at various academic institutions throughout his life, including in Germany, Switzerland, and the United States.
    In 1933, Einstein fled Nazi Germany and settled in the U.S., where he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>

    <p>Einstein was a pacifist and civil rights supporter, and he used his fame to advocate for peace and justice. He died on 
    18 April 1955 at the age of 76 in Princeton.</p>
